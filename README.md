# amazing-biochemistry
Hey there! Welcome to the Amazing Biochemistry repository! This is a place where I share my personal journey and notes on learning biochemistry. If you're curious about how life works at the molecular level, you've come to the right spot!

## What's Inside?
In this repository, you'll find the following sections:
- Notes: Iâ€™m planning to put everything from the basics to complex concepts, reactions, and pathways here. They'll help you get a solid understanding of the building blocks of life.
- Resources: This section is for external resources that I found super helpful. You'll find textbooks, research papers, online courses, and websites for learning more about biochemistry.
- Projects: Here, I hope to show some cool projects that bring biochemistry to life. These projects bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications. They'll help you see how biochemistry is important to our everyday lives.

## Contributing
I think it's important to work together. If you have more biochemistry notes, tools, or projects, I'd love it if you could share them.
